# Tower-Defence-Tweet-Visualiser
A data visualisation project that visualises tracked keywords from Tweets in the form of a Tower Defence game.

## How it Works?
A horde will slowly approach from the right side of the screen, making their way towards the castle. When the horde reaches the castle the game over screen will appear, the horde will reset and the game will automatically start again.

## How do you stop the horde?
The visualiser tracks a keyword/s entered into the backend. Every time a user tweets with the keyword, the castle attacks and kills the horde, resetting them to the right edge of the screen.

## How was this created?
The project was created using HTML Canvas, Javascript and Python for the Twitter streamer.
